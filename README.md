### High-Frequency Trading System
This project simulates a High-Frequency Trading (HFT) System designed to execute real-time stock trading with high performance, security, and scalability. It uses Rust, a systems programming language, to achieve low latency, safe concurrency, and robust error handling. The system consists of two main components:
 - Trading Side: Handles order generation, portfolio management, and communication with the stock side.
 - Stock Side: Simulates real-time stock price updates and order matching.
